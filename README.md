# The model code is build for smart attendance in an organistaion in post covid scenario i.e. Face recognition with mask and without mask. 
# It is build on 4 steps:
# 1. Detect faces
# 2. Compute 128-d face embeddings to quantify a face
# 3. Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) on top of the embeddings
# 4. Recognize face in video stream and mark the attendance
